## Arrays

1. Write a program which asks the user to enter `n` - the number of numbers he will enter. Then the program should ask for `n` numbers and print the contents of the array in reverse.

    | Example input | Example output |
    | ------------- | -------------- |
    | 3 1 2 3 | 3 2 1 |
    | 5 5 15 0 25 -10 | -10 25 0 15 5 |

1. Write a program which asks the user to enter `n` - the number of numbers he will enter. Then the program should ask for `n` numbers and print only the even numbers.

    | Example input | Example output |
    | ------------- | -------------- |
    | 3 1 2 3       | 2 |
    | 5 7 10 -4 11 3 | 10 -4 |

1. Write a program which asks the user to enter `n` - the number of numbers he will enter. Then the program should ask for `n` numbers and print only the numbers that are smaller than the average of all numbers.

    | Example input | Example output |
    | ------------- | -------------- |
    | 3 1 2 4       | 1 2 |
    | 5 7 10 -6 11 3 | -6 3 |
    
1. Write a program which asks the user to enter `n` - the number of numbers he will enter. Then the program should ask for `n` numbers and print the maximum of them.


    | Example input | Example output |
    | ------------- | -------------- |
    | 4 1 20 4 100      | 100 |
    | 5 -7 -10 -6 -11 -3 | -3 |

1. Write a program which asks the user to enter `n` - the amount of numbers he will enter. Then the program should ask for `n` numbers and determine if the given array is a *hacksaw*. We call a sequence of numbers `hacksaw` if the following is true:
`a1 < a2 > a3 < a4 ... an` or `a1 > a2 < a3 > a4 ... an`.


    | Example input | Example output |
    | ------------- | -------------- |
    | 4 5 4| 1 |
    | 5 4 5| 1 |
    | 4 5 3 8 9 4| 0 |
    | 1 2 1 2 1 2 1| 1 |
    | 10 -200 3 4| 0 |
    
   
1. Write a function which takes two arguments - an int array and its size, and prints all elements of the array on the console. 
   
1. Write a function which takes two arguments - an int array and its size, and reverses the array.
    Example: {7, 5, 13, -8, 6} -> {6, -8, 13, 5, 7}

1. Write a function which takes three arguments - two int arrays - `source` and `destination` and unsigned `s` - size of the source.The function has to copy all elements from `source` to `destination`(assume destination is big enough).

1. Write a function which takes two arguments - an int array and its size, and sorts the array.

1. Write a function which takes two arguments - an int array and its size, and returns its median.

1. Write a function which takes two arguments - an int array and its size, and returns its mode.

1. Write a function which takes three arguments - a *sorted* int array, size of the array and wanted value `c`. Using the algorithm binary search, the function should return the index of `c` if it exists in the array, or -1 if it does not exist.

1. Write a program which asks the user to enter `n` - the number of numbers he will enter. Then the program should ask for `n` numbers. Then the program should print on the console the elements of the longest increasing sequence in the array. In case there are two sequences with the same length, print the first one.

    | Example input | Example output |
    | ------------- | -------------- |
    | 4 1 20 4 100      | 1 20 |
    | 10 1 7 10 15 -5 0 1 2 3 4 | -5 0 1 2 3 4 |

1. TODO: Print whether a set is a subset of another set.
